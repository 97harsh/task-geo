### Description

Trello card : (Only for task-geo members.)

1. Describe your idea in simple, non technical terms, explaining what you want to
be done, and how it can benefit the Coronawhy community effort.
You can start by copying the contents of the trello card description.

2. Describe, if you know how, a basic technical approach that you propose. Don't dig to deep into details, just, module structure, function/class  prototypes ( input, output for functions, attributes, methods for classes)
